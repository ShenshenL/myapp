// in this file we build our main "App" component.
// inside it we will render a Headline and a InputComp component.
// to allow for that we need to inport them from other files.
//this is done in the next two lines:
import Headline from './Headline.js';
import InputComp from './InputComp.js';


//now we start building the App component. To start, we make a copy/an instance
//of React's Component "blueprint" which brings a lot of functionality. 
//On that, we then extend to make it our own.
class App extends Component {
  //This component has its own state (data). We initialize it 
  //in this constructor function. The only data we want for 
  //now is an array holding words. See it 4 lines below :)
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      words: ['paradise', 'bycicle', 'jianbing', 'timezone'],
    }
  }
  
  // this is the function that adds new words to the words array
  // in the state. 
  // further below we pass this function down to the InputiComp component,
  // so that new words that are entered there can directly be added.
  // the function has one parameter ("newWord") which means that 
  // when it is called we need to pass a string between the two brackets
  addWord = (newWord) => {
    // the string that is passed it which the function is called
    // is available under the variable name "newWord" withing this 
    // function.

    // we make a copy (with the "slice()" method) of the 
    // words array as it currently is:

    // the ".concat()" method allows us to 
    // combine two arrays (or here one array and a string)
    // and return a NEW array. This new array we store in
    // store in the variable "newWords"
    let newWords = this.state.words.concat(newWord);
    
    // overwrite the current words in our state
    // with the updated one
    this.setState({
      words: newWords
